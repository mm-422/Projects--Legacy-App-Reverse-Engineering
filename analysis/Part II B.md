# Part II B
The complications I encountered throughout decoding Puzzleball 3D with its relatively opaque routines and unconventional design led me to take a few steps back before re-evaluating my approach.

I decided to pick a simpler part of the application to tweak/modify this time to gather more information on how it responds to analysis and debugging tools. I wanted to eliminate any possible compatibility issues and ensure there were no "invisible" obfuscation steps that made using tools more challenging than necessary.

> GOAL: Fix a typo on launcher window.<br>

I noticed a misspelling on the launcher window where the product key was displayed.

The word "compter" here is missing a vowel. I thought attempting to remedy this could be a simple venture that would lead me to gather more info on how the application is built and designed.
