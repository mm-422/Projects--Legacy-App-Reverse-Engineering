# Part II C
With the integrity checks for both the main executable and the DLL file both bypassed, we are now free to modify them as we desire. It is interesting to note that switching goals earlier to "just fixing a typo" ended in performing two critical modifications to the application. However, we still have not achieved the goal of fixing the word "compter", and that is now our goal again.

>GOAL: Disable or fix "Fatal Not Found" error.
